# Before submitting pull request

* Your branch should be named `issues/XYZ` (or `issues/XYZ-shortDesc`), where `XYZ` is an issue number on GitHub. When your pull request is not related to any issue, branch name is arbitrary
* It is important to put meaningful description (in addition to issue number) in a pull request name
* Run full build:

        $ ./gradlew clean build

* Make sure you wrote unit tests, both for new features or bug fixes
* Add JavaDoc when applicable
* You should avoid breaking backward compatibility, especially repackaging and changing `public` methods
* Be carefull when changing dependencies
* You don't have to assign person and milestone
* Document new features in [Wiki](https://github.com/4finance/micro-infra-spring/wiki), especially new [configuration properties](https://github.com/4finance/micro-infra-spring/wiki/Configuration) after they are merged

# Rebasing your pull request
You should prefer rebasing your pull request instead of merging it. Let's assume that you have
a branch named `cool-feature`. Here are instructions needed to rebase your branch on top of master:

        $ git checkout cool-feature
        $ git pull --rebase origin master
        (Resolve conflicts if any. Squash commits if necessary.)
        $ git push origin cool-feature -f
        (Wait for Travis/Snap CI results, making sure your code isn't broken after rebase.)
        $ git checkout master
        $ git merge --ff-only cool-feature
        $ git push origin master

GitHub will detect automatically these operations and mark your pull request as merged.

**Note**. If you prefer to merge with --ff-only from GUI (when possible) go to GitHub [contact section](https://github.com/contact) and write about it. Sample message to copy/paste.

> Hi. It would be useful to be able to optionally merge PRs without a merge commit from GUI (if there were no other commits to master in the meantime).
