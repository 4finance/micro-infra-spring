/**
 * Quick and dirty @see{spock.util.environments.RestoreSystemProperties} variant which works at a specification level.
 *
 * System properties are restored to the state before the first setupSpec method after all tests and all cleanupSpec methods.
 *
 * A process to make it a part of Spock 1.0 is in progress.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Temporarily changing the values of system properties is only safe when specs are
 * run in a single thread per JVM. Even though many execution environments do limit themselves to one thread
 * per JVM, keep in mind that Spock cannot enforce this.
